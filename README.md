# Cancer Detection using Machine Learning Algorithms

This repository contains code and analysis for detecting cancer using various machine learning algorithms. We compare the performance of **logistic regression**, **decision tree**, and **random forest** models. Additionally, we include preprocessing steps to prepare the data for modeling.

## Dataset

The data is included in the repository (`data.csv`). The dataset contains information related to various risk factors associated with breast cancer.

## Project Structure

- `data.csv`: Contains the dataset.
- `cancer_clissifier.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook for data exploration, preprocessing, and model training.
- `README.md`: This file.

## Preprocessing Steps

1. **Feature Selection**: We remove the useless features that are irrelevent to the labels.

2. **Feature Scaling**: To ensure consistent scaling across features, we apply **standardization**.

## Model Implementation

We train the following machine learning models:

1. **Logistic Regression**: A linear model that predicts the probability of an instance belonging to a particular class.

2. **Decision Tree**: A tree-based model that splits the data based on feature thresholds to make predictions.

3. **Random Forest**: An ensemble of decision trees that combines their predictions for improved accuracy.

## Evaluation Metrics

We evaluate the models using the following metrics:

- **Accuracy**: Overall correctness of predictions.
- **Recall**: Ability to correctly identify positive cases (cancer).
- **Precision**: Proportion of true positive predictions among all positive predictions.
- **F1-score**: Harmonic mean of precision and recall.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/barzansaeedpour/cancer-detection.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the appropriate directory and run the Jupyter notebooks or Python scripts to explore the data, preprocess it, and train the models.
